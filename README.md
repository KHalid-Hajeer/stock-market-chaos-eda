# Stock Market Chaos EDA Portfolio

This repository contains exploratory data analyses (EDAs) focused on finding structure in chaotic financial data using entropy, uncertainty, and information theory concepts. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and improve predictability in stock market time series.

## Contents

- eda_1_market_noise_signal: Investigates entropy reduction in stock returns after applying technical indicators.
- (To Come):
  - eda_2_gbm_vs_stock: Compares real stock data to Geometric Brownian Motion simulations.
  - eda_4_model_uncertainty: Tests uncertainty and entropy in model predictions.

## How to Use

Each folder contains a standalone Jupyter notebook, data, assets, and a README detailing the project.
